# Prediction-of-whitle-wine-quality
The title of our project is Predict of White Wine Quality. White wine is a popular beverage that has been around for more than 7,000 years. In our daily life, white wine has also become our daily drink. There are many components in white wine, for example: volatile acidity, citric acid and residual sugar and so on. Some studies have shown that these components interact with each other to influence the quality and taste of white wine. Therefore, our group was interested in measuring the quality of white wine and want to know what substances affect the quality of a wine and what the concentration of each substance is in a good wine.

The Wine Quality Data Set we use in this project is provided by the University of California, Irvine.. This dataset includes 4899 observations and 12 variables.

Based on physicochemical tests, we have 11 input variables. The variables in the dataset are:

fixed acidity: fixed acidity

volatile acidity: volatile acidity, too high acidity will lead to poor taste of red wine

citric acid: citric acid, a small amount of citric acid can increase the freshness of red wine

residual sugar: residual sugar, that is, after the fermentation of alcohol has not been fermented and the residual sugar

chlorides: the salt in red wine

free sulfur dioxide: free sulfur dioxide, can prevent microorganisms and be oxidized

total sulfur dioxide: total sulfur dioxide, including free sulfur dioxide and bound sulfur dioxide, if the free sulfur dioxide concentration exceeds 50 ppm, people can feel the taste of sulfur dioxide

density: density of water, that is, water minus the volume of alcohol and sugar to calculate

pH: acidity, 0 (very acidic acid) to 14 (very basic base); mostly concentrated between 3-4 ph

sulphates: an additive that produces sulfur dioxide, which has antibacterial and antioxidant properties

alcohol: alcoholic strength

Based on sensory data, we have one output variable

quality: from low to high, score between 0 and 10.
In our project, we choose the variables which we think have significant influence in affecting the price of a house to somplify the data and try to reduce the collinearity between different predictors at beginning:

Through this study, we wanted to investigate which factors affect the quality of white wine and whether these factors are correlated and affect each other, and finally we wanted to find the most suitable model to predict the quality of white wine. With this model, we want to know which substances affect the quality of a white wine and we want to use this model to accurately predict the quality of a white wine.

Thus, we will complete three methods, method 1 we want to investigate which factors influence the quality of the wine. Method 2 we want to know if there is a relationship between these factors. Finally we will sift through the model to find the most appropriate model

In this project, many of the topics will be included, some of them will be:

Linear regression
GGplot
Model building
Model selection
